Just make sure you keep track of the changes you make, in case we're both editing it at the same time.
Or perhaps we could always upload a new version instead of overwriting it, just put the date/time at 
the beginning? (Like 920at513pm.java) That would probably work best, and it's a small file so it won't be difficult to do. And 
we can remove the older ones as time goes on. Also: this game is going to be awesome!
